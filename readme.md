# Reaktiv Workshops

This is a series of interactive and demo examples for the Reaktive workshops. Each folder is selfcontained so it is necesary to run `npm i` in each folder in order to initialize the bundler.

Once the NPM packages are installed the bundler can be started with `npm start` which will initiate any build processes, start a small server, and then watch for changes.

## Node Version

This was initially installed with Node v16.14.2 and that has been included in the `.nvmrc` file. It is possible to use the command `nvm use` to switch to that version if you are using NVM and have installed node version 16.14.2. You can use `nvm install` to add this version if needed.

Newer versions of node should also work for now. Older version are not guarunteed :)
