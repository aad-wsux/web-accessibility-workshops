# Reaktiv Workshops

This is a series of interactive and demo examples for the Reaktive workshops. Each folder is selfcontained so it is necesary to run `npm i` in each folder in order to initialize the bundler.

Once the NPM packages are installed the bundler can be started with `npm start` which will initiate any build processes, start a small server, and then watch for changes.
